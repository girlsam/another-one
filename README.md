*Note: This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).*

#### TODO
*where to begin*

1. Lots of optimizing to be done with `styled-components`: refactor theming to use CSS vars (even though this isn't supported in IE), extract dark/light mode functions higher up
1. Svg animations!
